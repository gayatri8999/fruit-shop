# Introduction to HTML
## What is HTML
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the building block of most webpages you see on the internet. It's like a behind-the-scenes instruction manual that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements.

### Browser
Imagine a library, but instead of bookshelves, there are endless rooms filled with information. A web browser is like your special tool to explore this library. It helps you find and view all this information stored on the internet.

### Editor
Imagine a high-tech writing desk specifically designed for programmers.  *VS Code* is like that desk, offering a powerful and flexible environment to write code.

Here's what makes it special-

- *Code Editing:* It highlights different parts of your code (like keywords and functions) with different colors, making it easier to read and understand.
- *Auto-completion:* As you type, VS Code suggests what you might be writing next, saving you time and reducing errors.
- *Syntax Checking:* It can catch typos and mistakes in your code, like a helpful grammar checker for programmers.
- *Multiple Files:* Work on different parts of your code simultaneously, like having multiple documents open on your desk.

### To push code on on repository we use following commands-
git status

git add .

git commit -m "here your changes"

git push

If you want to see changes of other group members in VS code then use
git pull
